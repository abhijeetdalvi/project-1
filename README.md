## Introduction

Let's implement a simple treasure hunt game, where you would need to move a player around in search for a _not-so-hidden_ treasure. But hold one, there are dangerous bats flying around in the sky. The player must collect the treasure which appears from the ground and disappears quickly. So the player must move around quickly to collect the treasure. The player is equipped with a gun to shoot down the bats.
